Repo with my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.
I just recently came across these problems so there are missing years.  Not sure If I will go back and finish them.

I have maintained the inputs problem inputs for each problem.  Typically you can just execute the code by going to the directory and running `$node index.js`
